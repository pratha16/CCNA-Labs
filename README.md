# CCNA-Labs
This repository is a collection of hands-on networking labs completed as part of my preparation for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA).
The labs are based on Packet Tracer activities from Jeremy’s IT Lab and cover core CCNA topics ranging from device security to VLANs, routing, and more.
